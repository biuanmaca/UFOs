# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This html/javascript app is designed to quickly and easily sort through the data of UFO sightings by their date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
When loading the html file/web page, the user will see text fields for each of the filterable data points and the followed by the full table of
data.  Enter the filter you wish to change and then press enter.  For example, you can set the date to "1/13/2010", which gives you three results.

You can enter multiple filters as well.  For example you can filter based on the shape ("light") and on the state ("ca"), which gives you 11 results.
(Note: example image does NOT show all results)

## Summary
While this is a functioning app there is one major issue in that you need to type every filter item (except date) in all lower case.  To resolve
that issue one can add scripting to turn all input by the user into all lower case for them.  In addition, it would be more useful for our 
research to be allowed to select date ranges rather than specific dates, so that we can see all sightings in January 2010, for instance.
